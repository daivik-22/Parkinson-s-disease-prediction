# Dataset Instructions

## Parkinson's Disease Dataset

This project uses the UCI ML Parkinson's Disease dataset. For copyright and size reasons, the dataset is not included directly in this repository.

### How to obtain the dataset:

1. Visit the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Parkinson's Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons)
2. Download the `parkinsons.data` file
3. Place the downloaded file in this directory (`data/`)
4. No further preprocessing is needed - the code will handle the data loading and processing

### About the dataset:

This dataset comprises a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds to one of 195 voice recordings from these individuals.
